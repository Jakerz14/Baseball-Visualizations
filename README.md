# Project-Portfolio
Here is my portfolio of some of my favorite projects that I have completed at JMU.

The 268 Final Project pdf and R markdown file is a project where I took a baseball dataset dating back to the 1890s, and made some fun visualizations.

The Data 200 Final project pdf and Python files relate to a project where a robot's distance from a wall was tracked over time and I visualized it and answered some questions for the project.
